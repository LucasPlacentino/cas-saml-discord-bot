# quidam-ulb-bot
A Discord bot for authenticating ULB students using QuIdAM CAS

### Currently at the idea stage
Possibly replacing [our own previous bot **ULBDiscordBot**](https://github.com/bepolytech/ULBDiscordBot) and inspired by [Opensource-IIITH/Discord-CAS](https://github.com/Opensource-IIITH/Discord-CAS)

OR use:

- https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/configuring-app-metadata-for-linked-roles
- https://github.com/discord/linked-roles-sample
- https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10388356626711-Connections-Linked-Roles-Admins
maybe with:
- https://apereo.github.io/2019/02/19/cas61-as-oauth-authz-server/
